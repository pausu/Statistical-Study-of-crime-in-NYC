# Statistical-Study-of-crime-in-NYC
Analysis of incident event data collected by the New York Police Department over a timespan of 18 years.

We present an investigation on temporal and spatial patterns of census and incident public data
retrieved from the NYC Open data portal. We observe that the relative frequency of
crime events has been quite stable over the years for all neighborhoods we considered, 
and that it is possible to cluster blocks over homogeneous regions to identify the city areas which should
be considered more dangerous. The analysis is carried out using fused lasso methods, both for one- and two-dimensional data.
